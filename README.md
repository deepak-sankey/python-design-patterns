# Python: Design Patterns

## Problem Statement:

You are a member of the selection committee for the Indian team. You are selecting the a team for World Cup 2019.
Write an application that enables you to add a player to the Indian team. The player can be of the below types : Batsmen, Bowler, All- rounder, Wicket Keeper
Only 15 players can be added to the squad. Only 2 wicket keepers are allowed.
Application should also allow to view the team members with all filters.


## Note:

   1. The assigned design pattern should be implemented in given problem statement. Tweaks if required can be made to the problem statement after disusing with us.
   2. Program without coding standards/best practices and just with output will not be accepted.
   3. Any assumptions made should be clearly stated.
   4. Python should be used as a programming language
   5. All functionalities should be exposed as Rest API's.


## Getting Started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

- pip
```

### Installation: Linux

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
#1. Create a virtual environment:  python -m venv venv
#2. Activate the virtual environment: source venv/Scripts/activate
#3. Install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
#4. Setup a flask application: export FLASK_APP=run.py
#5. Run the application: flask run
```

### Installation: Windows

```
#1. Create a virtual environment:  python -m venv venv
#2. Activate the virtual environment: venv\Scripts\activate
